# Pedestrian Detection System using YOLO
This project has been built to support Campus Planning Department at Facilities Management in University of Massachusetts Lowell. This project aims to develop a Tool powered by Machine Learning Techniques to count the number of persons walking across certain paths on campus. We have utilised Powerful Deep Learning Algorithm - YOLO(You Only Look Once) developed by Ultralytics for solving the problem of detecting persons in a video file. 

The tool developed provides with a User Interface which allows you to upload a video and select regions of paths on which the detection needs to be performed and detects, tracks and counts the number of persons passing across the paths.

## Prerequisites <a name='prerequisites'></a>

### Environment <a name='environment'></a>

1. Python 3 Environment
2. Python modules required: NumPy, Pandas, PyTorch, Opencv2, Matplotlib, Ultralytics, Supervision, Tkinter, TQDM

OR
- Any Python3 IDE installed with the above modules. (Pycharm is used in the development of this project)

### Video Description <a name='video-description'></a>

The tool supports the usage of timelapse videos of any kind and any size with a good resolution and frame rate. Optimise your frame rate and quality of the video based on how big are the persons in the video(Smaller persons in the frame requires the video to be more clear).
The video used during the development and testing of the model is a timelapse video of a place on the campus of UMass Lowell which contains multiple paths on which number of people passing has to be counted.
##### Test Video Information 

- Height - 720
- Width - 1280
- Frame Rate - 30
- Timelapse Rate - 1 Hour/minute
