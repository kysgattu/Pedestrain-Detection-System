# Pedestrian Detection System using YOLO
The Pedestrian Detection System using YOLO is an innovative project designed to assist the Campus Planning Department at Facilities Management in the University of Massachusetts Lowell. The primary objective of this initiative is to create a tool that leverages advanced Machine Learning Techniques, specifically utilizing the potent YOLO (You Only Look Once) Deep Learning Algorithm developed by Ultralytics. The purpose of this tool is to accurately count the number of individuals traversing specific pathways across the university campus.

With a user-centric approach, we have crafted a sophisticated User Interface as an integral part of the tool. This interface enables users to effortlessly upload a video and define specific regions along the paths where pedestrian detection is required. The system seamlessly executes the process of detecting, tracking, and tallying the number of individuals traversing these designated pathways.

By incorporating YOLO, renowned for its efficiency in object detection tasks, our system ensures robust and real-time detection capabilities. This translates to a more streamlined and accurate monitoring process, enhancing the overall efficiency of the Campus Planning Department in managing pedestrian flow.

In summary, the Pedestrian Detection System utilizing YOLO stands as a testament to the integration of cutting-edge technology to address practical challenges. By providing a user-friendly interface and leveraging the power of YOLO, this project facilitates the precise and automated counting of pedestrians, thereby contributing to the enhancement of campus planning and management at the University of Massachusetts Lowell.

## Prerequisites <a name='prerequisites'></a>

### Environment <a name='environment'></a>

1. Python 3 Environment
2. Python modules required: NumPy, Pandas, PyTorch, Opencv2, Matplotlib, Ultralytics, Supervision, Tkinter, TQDM

OR
- Any Python3 IDE installed with the above modules. (Pycharm is used in the development of this project)

### Video Description <a name='video-description'></a>

The tool supports the usage of timelapse videos of any kind and any size with a good resolution and frame rate. Optimise your frame rate and quality of the video based on how big are the persons in the video(Smaller persons in the frame requires the video to be more clear).
The video used during the development and testing of the model is a timelapse video of a place on the campus of UMass Lowell which contains multiple paths on which number of people passing has to be counted.
##### Test Video Information 

- Height - 720
- Width - 1280
- Frame Rate - 30
- Timelapse Rate - 1 Hour/minute
